# Airbnb Listing Ratings Prediction in Dublin

## Problem Statement

### Dataset

Download the `listings.csv` and `reviews.csv` files from the "Dublin, Leinster, Ireland" section on the [Inside Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
- The `listings` data contains review scores for individual property listings, including ratings for accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, and value.
- The ratings are generally high values (>4).
- The reviews may contain non-text content like emojis, and not all reviews are in English.

### Assignment

1. Evaluate the feasibility of predicting individual ratings (accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, and value) and the overall review rating for Airbnb listings in Dublin.
2. Determine which features are associated with high ratings, such as the impact of superhosts or neighborhood on ratings and if highly rated listings tend to have more reviews.
3. Pay attention to feature selection and select two distinct machine learning approaches to apply to the dataset.
4. Critically evaluate the prediction performance of the chosen approaches.
5. Justify design choices, explain methods, and present supporting data and conclusions in a clear manner.
